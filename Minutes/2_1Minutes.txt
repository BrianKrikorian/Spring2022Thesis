* 4 Folders in the main branch, not branches themselves
   * Manuscript
   * Code
   * Data
   * References - include bibtex link for papers such as Greg Matthewsâ€™
      * Give a 1 to 2 sentence summary on each article
Analyzing my data so far
* Check whether top players are in fact top with my metric PAR
* How does my metric line up with other metrics used in basketball?
   * That would be how we use PAR as an observation on other things, not just as a response
* Center and standardize and plot the 5 metrics, including PAR, to get them on the same scale (variance of 1)
   * Offensive and Defensive points, positional adjustment, points per win, and PAR
* Cluster graphs for the metrics to see if players with similar play styles do in fact line up
* 5 or 6 github commands are really needed, push, pull, commit, add, status, etc.
   * Become more familiar with these while doing project
* In the future, create an R program that will allow these functions to run
* Data Science Lab, UConn Sports Analytics on YouTube.
