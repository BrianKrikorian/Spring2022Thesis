* 3 folders
   * Manuscript: For writing part of thesis
   * Data: For files that data is recorded on
   * Code: Relative paths
* Observed Y for model to fit: PAR (Points Above Replacement)
   * How many points a team gives up or gains by replacing a certain player with a league average player at his position
* Study the papers that presented WAR in baseball, Greg Matthews involved?
* Collect data (from 2020-2021 season, so no need to update every day) for every player, including their position
* Average out all stats for each position (.csv file for each position) and make a formula similar to WAR, but relative to points in a game, not wins in a season
* Put these notes in the repository, to go over next meeting
